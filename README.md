# Optimizing-EV-Charging-Station-Locations

In Spring 2024, I completed a team project for a Business Analytics course that I took, which counted as credit toward my master's program requirements. I applied clustering analysis and optimization techniques to the EV industry in the State of Washington to optimize and provide recommendations regarding which zip code clusters may be better targeted for expanding charging infrastructure. Attached in this repo is our written report and code with our EDA, visualizations, and insights.
